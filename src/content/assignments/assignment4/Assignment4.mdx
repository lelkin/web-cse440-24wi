# Assignment 4: Communicating Your Design

{/* <Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert> */}

## Overview

You have identified a problem, explored a design space, selected a promising design, and iterated on that design.
It is now time to focus on communicating your design and your design process.
This group assignment communicates your design through
a __web post__ and through a __poster__ with an associated __pitch__.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of five milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 4 Web
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment4web'}>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design
and your underlying design process in a post appropriate for a web portfolio.

Prepare a post documenting your process of getting the right design and then getting the design right.
Your post will be integrated into the course website via the <GeneratedLink href={"/projects"}>Projects</GeneratedLink> page,
used to both advertise the course poster session and to provide an archive of course projects.
Your prior milestones provide significant content you can draw upon in this post,
but this post is intended for an audience of future readers reviewing your design work.
Not all content from prior milestones will be included,
you should update your prior work based on feedback received throughout your design process
(e.g., re-making a design sketch or storyboard for clarity in this communication),
and you will ultimately emphasize a few key insights that most informed your design.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
(e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
by re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

Be sure that your post takes a tone of "presenting" and "reflecting" on your project.
You are not "selling" the resulting design, but are instead "sharing" your work with an interested audience.
You can and should express enthusiasm, but do not let that enthusiasm undermine the substance of your content.

Your post should follow the outline below.
It will be authored using Markdown and provided components for including images.
Be sure to inspect and understand the template text provided in your project directory.

1. __Title and Logo__

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   An attractive project logo. It will be used to link to your project from the main projects page.

2. __Problem and Design Overview__:

   Provide a concise statement of the problem you are addressing and a brief introduction of your design.

   This might be a single paragraph or two short paragraphs.
   You should likely include an image from or of your design to help build interest.
   Your goal is to set a context and then to motivate a reader to want to continue to learn about your work.

3. __Design Research Process and Key Insights__:

   _Design Research Process_

   First provide a concise overview of your design research process in Assignment 2, including:

   - The goals of your design research (i.e., your focus, your primary need for additional understanding).
   - The methods and participants you engaged in your design research.
   - Your rationale (i.e., why you chose your specific methods and participants).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your design research process in Assignment 2.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   - For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
     (e.g., how your understanding was shaped by design research,
     how your understanding was shaped by critique or feedback).
     Use specific evidence whenever possible
     (e.g., quotes or stories from participants,
     pictures captured during observations,
     pivots in your approach or thinking that resulted from critique or feedback,
     key reasons you chose one design over alternatives,
     key reasons you combined ideas from multiple design alternatives).
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
     but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Minimizing Burden", "Creating Social Connections")
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   - Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your design sketches or storyboards).

   These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.

4. __Iterative Design Process and Key Insights__:

   _Iterative Design Process_

   First provide a concise overview of your iterative design process in Assignment 3, including:

   - Your design focus (i.e., the tasks on which you focused iterative design).
   - Your process (e.g., your paper prototyping, inspection, usability testing, and digital mockup).

   Your goal is to set a context for the insights this process revealed.

   This might be a single paragraph.
   You should likely include an overview image of your paper prototype.

   _3 Key Insights_

   Then provide 3 key insights from your iterative design process in Assignment 3.
   Your goal is to convey key insights that informed your design and how each insight is based in your design process.

   - For each insight, discuss how the insight emerged
     (e.g., the state of a design element prior to the insight,
     the activity, observation, critique, or feedback that prompted you to iterate upon a design element,
     an aspect of transitioning to a digital mockup that required re-working your design)
     and how you iterated upon the design in result
     (e.g., showing a design element before and after an iteration).
   - Use specific evidence whenever possible
     (e.g., quotes from or observations of participants).
   - Do not number your insights (e.g., "Insight 1", "Insight 2", "Insight 3"),
     but instead give them a descriptive title (e.g., "Simplifying Data Collection", "Improving Legibility", "Removing Gender Assumptions")
     or consider that each paragraph could begin with a single bolded sentence summarizing the insight.
   - Use images as appropriate for conveying the insight (e.g., images from your paper prototyping or digital mockup).

   These might each be a single paragraph with a descriptive heading.

5. __Resulting Design__:

   Present key elements of your final design.
   Convey the critical aspects of your design,
   including the two primary tasks demonstrated in your digital mockup
   (e.g., as scenarios demonstrating the task with images from your digital mockup).

   This section may primarily be a set of images,
   but be sure you organize those images with enough text for a reader to understand the resulting design.

#### Submission

Evidence from Medium suggests that effective posts can be read in approximately 7 minutes:

[https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b)

#### Samples of Prior Submissions

<Alert severity='warning'>
    <div>Some samples are from a significantly revised prior milestone.</div>
</Alert>

This is a relatively new assignment, in which we have:

1. Removed submission of a report after Assignment 2 and then again after Assignment 3.

2. Instead required a single web post as part of Assignment 4.

3. Structured that post to emphasize your distillation of a handful of key insights.

Examples of reports and posts are linked from projects in prior offerings,
but be sure your submission is designed for the new format and emphasis of this assignment:

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 4 Poster
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment4poster'}>

The goal of this milestone is to create a poster and a pitch that communicate your design to a broad audience.

Create a poster that communicates your design and your design process.
Present your work in a visual form that quickly conveys its most important aspects.
Your poster should include:

- Project Title
- Logo
- Your Names
- Problem
- Value Proposition
- Key Functionality
- Key Insights (at least two)

Note: The Key Insights sections is new to this offering. Previous offerings had a "Design Process and Iteration" section instead,
so your poster will look different from the provided samples.
You might show key insights using before and after images, an image from a storyboard with a quote that influenced your design,
or any other mechanism you see fit.

Your poster should emphasize images and include limited amounts of text.
For consistency and ease of display, it should be 32"x40" (i.e., portrait, vertical).
A PowerPoint template is available here:

<p><a href={path4posterTemplate}>poster_template.pptx</a></p>

You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project.

Make sure all images you include are clear and legible (e.g., with appropriate contrast).
Re-make images as necessary to ensure this
(e.g., by taking new photos in better lighting, by instead using a scanner,
by re-creating a piece of a paper prototype using ink that will create a better image).

During the final poster session, your team will give a one minute pitch to a small group of judges.
Create a pitch that summarizes the problem and your design.
This pitch should convince an audience that your problem was worth investigating and that your design suggests a compelling direction.

#### Submission

Due to challenges that frequently arise in printing, submit both:

- A PDF of your poster.
- The source file for your poster (e.g., PPT, PPTX).

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />

Submit via Canvas here:

<p><AssignmentCanvasLink milestone={'assignment4poster'} /></p>

#### In Class

We will bring 8.5"x11" printed copies of your poster to class.
You will need these for in-class critique and refinement.

#### Grading

Your poster should be complete for critique and feedback, but only the final version will be graded.
Note that grading of the final poster does allocate points to your sufficient preparation for critique and feedback.

Critique and refinement will help further improve your poster before a final version.

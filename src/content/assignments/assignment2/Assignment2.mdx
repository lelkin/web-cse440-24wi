# Assignment 2: Getting the Right Design

{/* <Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert> */}

## Overview

Even when a problem is well-motivated, understanding that problem and choosing a design to pursue is a difficult process.
This group assignment, spanning multiple weeks of the course, tackles the problem of selecting the right design through
__design research__, __task development__, __generating multiple potential designs__, and finally __selecting a design__ to pursue.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is a group assignment, consisting of eight milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2A
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2a'}>

The goal of this milestone is to begin thinking about how to plan effective design research to inform your design process.

Generate 5 to 10 different ideas related to each of the following aspects of your project proposal:

- Forms: types of technology on which a design might be developed (e.g., wearable sensors, watch/phone/tablet, desktop, appliances or other artifacts in the environment).
- Data: types of data a design might track or help a person track.
- Tasks: what a person might accomplish with a design.
- Features: a specific capability a design might have.
- Social Interactions: types of social interactions and situations a design might engage or support.

We will provide large sheets of paper. Divide a large sheet of paper into 32 squares, each approximately 2in by 2in.
Sketch your ideas, one in each square. Each idea should be either a quick doodle with a caption or a one-sentence idea.
A person familiar with your project but not in your group should be able to understand the idea each sketch conveys.

The goal is to begin exploring the space of possibilities, not attempting to polish some individual possibility.
Focus on the quantity of ideas, not the quality of any one idea.
You may include ideas from existing products, but no two ideas should be alike.
When you get stuck, find a context to inspire new ideas.

After this brainstorming, you will have a broad space of possible directions.
Your project will soon need to gather information on how to generate and consider ideas in these directions.
Following up on the above, additionally brainstorm:

- People: types of people you might work with to learn more about problems and opportunities.
- Focus: what parts of the problems and opportunities you might focus on learning more about.
- Method: how you might engage those people to learn more about problems and opportunities.

#### Submission and Grading

There is no submission for this milestone.

</CollapseProjectMilestone>

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2B
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2b'}>

The goal of this milestone is to develop an initial plan for your design research,
encouraging you to work through details of how you would conduct that research
and improving those details through critique and peer feedback.

As part of Assignment 2, you are required to conduct design research
(e.g., contextual inquiry, interviews, observations)
to learn from at least __three__ people who might use your design.

In the first paragraph, describe the people who might use your design and other stakeholders to consider in your design.
Among potential stakeholders, describe the participants you plan to pursue,
including such details as their background and the environment where you will examine their current practices.
Describe your recruitment plan in enough detail to convince us that you can actually find and engage with your target participants in the next week.

- For example, if you are designing a health application for practitioners, your target participants should not be "doctors"
  but instead a specific group of doctors (e.g., Family Practitioners in the UW Roosevelt Clinic).
  Other stakeholders might include their patients, nurses, etc.

  {/*
  * Old text is point below only asked for this for populations that are difficult to access, 
  * which did not match what we were expecting when grading.
  */}

- Whether you are designing for a population that is difficult to access (e.g., as with busy doctors),
  or a population that seems relatively trivial (e.g., undergraduate students at the University of Washington),
  you must describe the steps you have already taken to gain access to and/or find participants and your plans to recover if you are unable to do so.
  Indicate when you will be conducting your design research, being as specific as possible.

In another paragraph, describe the __specific design research methods__
you will use to engage with and learn from these people.
A typical expected method would be contextual inquiry with three participants.
However,  we encourage you to propose alternative or additional design research methods according to your needs.
Please be as specific as possible, providing relevant details for you proposed methods. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, discuss current behaviors you want to observe and your planned focus.
- If you propose interviews, discuss the types of questions you plan to explore.
- If you propose a diary study, discuss what type of data you plan to ask participants to bring or collect.

On a second page, provide more detail regarding your primary proposed method. For example:

- If you propose contextual inquiries, enumerate what activities you intend to observe,
  what focus you intend to bring to observation of each activity,
  and any strategies you intend to pursue for gaining insight through your observations.
- If you propose interviews, give an example set of planned talking points.
- If you propose a diary study, give details of what and how you will ask participants to diary.

Be prepared to discuss your design research plan.

Bring several printed copies of your submission (e.g., four),
so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __10 points__:

1. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of People__: (3 points)
2. __Overall Feasibility and Specificity of Design Methods__: (3 points)
3. __Primary Method Details__: (2 points)

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2C
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2c'}>

The goal of this milestone is to begin your design research,
reflect on what you observe and learn,
then update your plans for additional design research.

Complete design research with at least one participant prior to this check-in.
You hopefully learned something about the needs of people who might use your design,
but also about effectively conducting your design research.

Describe your first design research participant and your findings:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **six** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Then discuss what remains to be pursued in your additional design research.
We fully expect changes will be necessary, as design research
can be difficult to get right and often important topics are left unresolved.

- Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?
- What are your plans for the remaining participants?
- How do you plan to change your design research plan based on what you learned with your first participant?

so that you can easily present them to peers for critique.

#### Grading

This milestone will be graded on a scale of __8 points__:

1. __Description of Participant__: (1 point)
2. __Specific Findings__: (6 x .5 points)
3. __Plan for Remaining Participants__: (2 points)
4. __Clarity and Presentation__: (2 points)

#### Samples of Prior Submissions

<ProjectMilestoneSamples milestone='assignment2c' />

</CollapseProjectMilestone>

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2D
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2d'}>

The goal of this milestone is to reflect on what you observed and learned in your design research,
organizing observations around themes and developing insights into tasks that can help inform your design.

#### Identifying Themes

Complete design research with a total of at least three participants. Discuss your process and what you learned:

- What did you do?
  - Who you observed or interviewed, their relevant background or context.
- What did you learn?
  - List **at least eight** specific findings based on what you observed or learned.
  - For example, what specific tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?

We expect findings will be short but concrete.
For example, findings might be organized as a bulleted list,
where each bullet starts with a bolded summary of the finding
and then shares a participant quote or researcher observation that informed that finding.

Although you now have more participants, this milestone asks for relatively few additional findings.
We expect you will curate your findings
(e.g., to focus on those which are most interesting, to convey the range of things you learned).

Across your participants, we expect some emergence of common themes, problems, and practices.

- Identify high-level themes and problems that are suggested by your findings across multiple participants.
- Do your findings, themes, and problems suggest tasks that are important to design for?

If you are having trouble identifying high-level themes, problems, and design opportunities,
it may indicate a need to develop additional understanding through more design research.
Because your findings at this point are critical to setting a foundation for your project,
ensure your design research has provided you the insights and perspective you need to proceed.

#### Task Analysis Questions

Informed by your design research, provide brief answers to the following questions.
These should help you begin to identify tasks essential to your design.

1. Who is going to use the design?
2. What tasks do they now perform?
3. What tasks are desired?
4. How are the tasks learned?
5. Where are the tasks performed?
6. What is the relationship between the person and data?
7. What other tools does the person have?
8. How do people communicate with each other?
9. How often are the tasks performed?
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
11. What happens when things go wrong?

#### Submission

No more than four pages of text in PDF format, to include:

{/*
* Used to be Design resesearch findings and themes (two pages)
* But some teams thought that meant the themes should be included in the 8 findings.
*/}

- Summary of key findings or takeaways (one paragraph at beginning).
- Design research participants (one or two paragraphs).
- Eight design research findings (less than one and a half pages).

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 2E
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2e'}>

The goal of this milestone is to develop a set of tasks that you will explore in a set of potential designs.

Building on what you learned in your design research, design __six tasks__ that you believe are important to your design goal:

- Remember that tasks say what is accomplished, while leaving open how to accomplish it.
- Select tasks to capture the important aspects of the problem you are solving and to provide coverage of designs you will explore.
- Create tasks based on your observations and analyses of existing tasks (i.e., tasks people already do)
  as well as your vision for new tasks (i.e., tasks that will be enabled by your potential designs).
- These should be real world tasks that include details
  (e.g., instead of "programming a DVR", details like "programming a DVR to record Spongebob on Sundays").
  Such details can then be explored in scenarios with the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
- Tasks should not have any specific relation to the potential designs you will develop in later milestones.
  Although it can be helpful to describe a task in the context of a specific scenario,
  the task itself should be more general and potentially achieved using multiple potential designs.
- Your six tasks should span a wide range of functionality and difficulty.

Each task be presennted as a bolded sentence at the beginning of a paragraph
and should concisely convey a problem and what is accomplished.
The remainder of the paragraph should be a step-by-step walkthrough of a potential scenario with a specific design.

As you progress in your project, you can and should consider revising your tasks.
Expect to refine or change your tasks as your understanding of the problem matures or according to feedback you receive.
The tasks you develop in this milestone therefore must be appropriate but are not necessarily final.

#### Submission

No more than two pages of text in PDF format, to include:

- Six task descriptions (one paragraph each).

  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2f'} revisionMilestone={'assignment2f_rev'}>

The goal of this milestone is to develop distinct design ideas that address your tasks.

You have identified and described six important tasks for your design problem.
You will now brainstorm and sketch three very different __initial designs__ for your interface:

 - Each design should support four of your tasks, but they do not necessarily need to all support the same four tasks.
 - Sketch key aspects needed to illustrate the functionality in your four tasks.
   A design may imply additional tasks, but do not illustrate the entire design.
 - These should be rough sketches (i.e., not digital mockups),
   including illustrations of their relations (e.g., arrows showing transitions and relationships).

<InformalDrawingTool />

The purpose of these sketches is to explore the design space before you lock yourself into a single design.
They must demonstrate significant consideration of substantially different approaches to your problem.

After receiving critique on Thursday, update your designs ahead of additional critique on Friday.

#### Submission

No more than three pages of text in PDF format, to include:

- Six task descriptions (one paragraph each, updated as needed from prior assignment).
- For each of three initial designs:
  - The high-level idea of the design (one paragraph).
  - Images of the design (sketches, not digital mockups).
  - How to complete each of the four sketched tasks (e.g., a list of steps, one or two sentences per task).

Be sure:

- <GroupAssignment />
- <ClarityAndPresentationReference />
- <ContributionStatementReference />
- <ParticipantAnonymity />
- After receiving critique on Thursday, submit an updated version.
  In the same additional separate PDF in which you submit your Contribution Statement,
  also provide a brief explanation of revisions (e.g., one paragraph on what you revised, why you revised it).

  * ASSIGNMENT 2G
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2g'}>

The goal of this milestone is to choose a design idea to pursue in the remainder of this course.

From your design sketches, select one design that you will refine in the remainder of this course.
Then select two tasks that will be the focus of your design refinement.
The selected tasks need to be representative of the experience of using your design.
They should be non-trivial, critical to solving your problem, and should emphasize long-lived or repeated activities.
In contrast, a one-time login screen for a social networking application
is not worth being the focus of your project, does not define your project functionality, and is not sufficiently interesting.

Prepare one paragraph describing _why you selected the design_ and _why you selected the tasks_ you did.
Draw upon feedback from critiques and data from your design research.

 - Why this design and these tasks?
 - What makes the design better suited to the people for whom you are targeting your design?
 - Why are these tasks more compelling than the others?

Convey a strong understanding of which design you chose, which tasks you chose, and why you chose them.

Then _create a storyboard of each task_ for your selected design.
Storyboards should clearly indicate the functionality of the design and what it will be like,
conveying the major aspects of the design in enough detail that
a person not in your group can understand how the design supports each task.
They should establish motivation and satisfaction,
should show insight into the task and design, and should include one or more characters and settings.
To ensure clarity of your story,
storyboards should not include any unneeded frames or unnecessary details across multiple frames.
As needed, ensure clarity of your story through captions,
other brief descriptions, selective use of color, or other techniques.

<InformalDrawingTool />

#### Submission

No more than one page of text in PDF format, to include:

 - Discussion of your design and task choices (one paragraph).
 - Images of your storyboards and associated captions or descriptions.

  * ASSIGNMENT 2P
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment2p'}>

The goal of this milestone is to effectively communicate your design research in a presentation.

Prepare a presentation of your process in getting the right design. It should encompass all of your work in Assignment 2.

- Two members of your team should deliver the presentation, each speaking to relatively equal portions.
- Presenters should be different from those for Assignment 3, such that everybody presents at least once this quarter.
  If there is some reason this cannot work for your team, be sure you have communicated with us.
- A 7 minute time limit will be strictly enforced, with additional time for questions.

Your presentation should include:

1. __Title Slide__:

   A short, creative, and marketable title capturing the key idea.

   Include team member names. Be clear which team members are presenting.

2. __Overall Problem__:

   Convey that your problem is both important and appropriate for a design investigation.

   Motivate your audience to be interested in your problem.
   Consider using data or statistics regarding importance of the problem.
   Consider using a scenario or story to convey an emotional or human perspective on the problem.
   Be sure to avoid simply reading slide bullets, as you need to develop a connection to your audience.

3. __Design Research__:

   Convey what design research you conducted. This should include:
   - Your methods (i.e., what design research did you do).
   - Your participants (i.e., what participants did you engage).
   - Your key findings (i.e., what key things did you learn that will inform your design).

   Consider including images that give your audience a feeling for your work.

4. __6 Tasks__:

   Convey the breadth of tasks you have considered, in at most one sentence per task.

5. __3 Design Sketches__:

   Convey the breadth of designs you considered.

   Be clear what is the key idea or difference in each of your three designs.

6. __Selected Design Storyboards and Tasks__:

   Present your storyboards, ensuring they effectively illustrate your selected design and tasks.

   Convey your rationale for choosing this as a design focus.

We strongly recommend rehearsing your presentation beforehand.
For example, arrange to practice together with another group or two, giving each other feedback on your presentations.

Note that we have not set a required number of slides in each section of this presentation.
You can deliver your presentation using as many or as few slides as you want,
as long as your presentation successfully addresses the above points in the allowed time.

#### Submission

Your presentation may be in PPT, PPTX, or PDF format.

To minimize switching time, we will have all presentations on a single laptop running Microsoft Windows.
You should optimize your presentation for portability (e.g., ensure any necessary fonts are embedded).
If we detect any obvious formatting issues on the presentation machine, we may fix them or contact you to fix them.
But you are ultimately responsible for your presentation.

### Grading

The course staff will have a grading form they keep during your presentation:

<p><a href={path2pPresentationStaffForm}>2p-presentation-staff-form.pdf</a></p>

The content of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __16 points__:

- Presentations should not have an outline slide.
  They are short enough to be told as a story of your process, and your outline is the same as every other presentation.
  Instead use that time to tell us about your project.
- The problem should be presented in a manner that is compelling and achievable.
- Design research should be carried out and presented in an appropriate manner.
  This should include methods, participants, and key findings.
- Tasks should provide coverage of envisioned functionality and be motivated by the design research.
- Design ideas should be distinct and have a connection to results of design research.
- The selected design and task storyboards should be compelling and have a connection to results of design research.
- Presentations should show appropriate preparation,
  with slides that are legible and content that is effective, properly prepared, and properly employed.
- Presentations should cover the required scope within the allowed time.

The delivery of this presentation will be graded on a scale of __4 points__:

- Presenter makes eye contact with the audience.
- Presenter projects their voice well and is audible throughout the room.
- Presenter feels engaged with the content, not just reading slides.
- Presenter covers the required scope within the allowed time.
